# SQL_Sales_Data_Analysis_Walmart

In this SQL project, I've used basic to intermediate-level SQL queries to explore the sales data of Walmart.

The sales data for Walmart was available as a CSV file. I imported the table into MySQL Server and created a database on my local machine.

I performed various SQL queries to carry forward with the analysis.
